The procees of using Github 
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin master 

////// git checkout and Merge
git checkout branch name -----> used when you have an existing branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name -----> used when you want to create new branch

///// git Merge
###Switch into branch you want to make changes into:
git checkout main

###Merge the other branch into current branch
git merge new-branch

### Delete the branch
git branch -d branch-name

NB: You can also force delete without merging changes :
git branch -D branch-name

### Delete remote repository
git push origin --delete branch-name
----> this will remove branch from remote repository where it's store e.g Github
and once deleted it will not appear locally as well
